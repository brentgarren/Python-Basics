# Python-Basics and yes we going really basic

-### This is an example of print() Which output a line of code<br>
-### Text preceded with a # are comments and are ignored when running scripts<br>
Comments are written by the programmer in this case Me to allow future programmers YOU to understand what the script is supposed to do<br>

print("Hello World")<br>

Anything within the ( ) would be outputed in this case Hello World<br>
when printing a string ( ) we need to include the " "

# Mathematical Operators
<pre>
OPERATOR | SYMBOL | EXAMPLE <br>

ADDITION       |  +  | 1 + 1 = 2 <br>
SUBTRACTION    |  -  | 5 - 1 = 4 <br>
MULTIPLICATION |  *  | 10 * 10 = 100 <br>
DIVISION       |  /  | 10 / 2 = 5 <br>
MODULUS        |  %  | 10 % 2 = 0 <br>
EXPONENTIAL    |  ** | 5**2  = 25 (52) <br>

Greater Than   | >   | 
Less Than      | <   |
Equal to       | ==  |
Not Equal to   | !=  |
Greater than or equal to  | >= |
Less than or equal | <= |

# Variables

Variables allow you to store and update data in a computer program. You have a variable name and store data to that name.<br>
<pre>Example: 
  | Fruit = Apple |
  | Leaves = 15 |
</pre>

In the example above, we have 2 variables. The variable name "fruit" stores the string (words) ice cream, while another variable called "leaves" stores a number (2000).

Variables are powerful as you can change them throughout your program. The following example sets the age variable to 30, then we increase this age variable by 1, making the final variable data 31.

<pre>
Age = 30
Age = age + 1
Print(age)
</pre>

<h3>Data Types</h3>
<pre>
String - Used for combinations of characters, such as letters or symbols
Integer - Whole Numbers
Float - Numbers that contain decimals or fractions
Boolean - Used for data that is restricted as either true or false
List - Series of different data types stored in a collection
